# Groove.mx

## Installation

```
yarn
```

## How to run locally
```
npm run dev
```

## How we add playlists

Add an entry in `playlists.js`. The app takes care after that.

Don't forget to download their images:

First, generate a Spotify app and setup your credentials
```
export GROOVE_MX_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
export GROOVE_MX_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

and then
```sh
npm run images
```
